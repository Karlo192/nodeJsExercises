                <p>
                    By the end of our first few Node.js classes, we had to go through 
                    some Js basics. We worked with arrays, objects, strings and 
                    did some console-logging as well. Here you can see a few code snippets
                    from our first classes:
                </p>
                <br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/js_basics.png" id="pic-content"/>
                    <img src="/js_objects.png" id="pic-content" />
                </div>
                <p>
                    Once the basics were covered and we were able to read the written code, 
                    we started to create our own servers. This is the structure of the server,
                    and to create it I will explain the process in steps...
                </p>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/server_structure.png" id="pic-content" style="width: 250px; height: 170px;">
                    <p>
                        <b>STEP 1:</b><i> Create empty folder and make a "package.json" file</i><br><br>
                        <b>STEP 2:</b><i> Open the "package.json" file and on line one, write curly brackets (as an
                        annotation for an empty object, "{}")</i><br><br>
                        <b>STEP 3:</b><i> Open up the terminal and do a "cd" command (to change directory) and specify path
                        where you have created the "package.json" file</i><br><br>
                        <b>STEP 4:</b><i> Run "npm install express" or "npm i express" in the terminal - this will install the 
                        <a href="/express">EXPRESS</a> package which we will use as our minimalistic web framework for Node</i>
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    After these steps, 2 things happend - the Express dependency has been added to the "package.json" file, inside the
                    empty curly-brackets annotation and a "package-lock.json" file was created, as well as a "node_modules" folder.
                    This folder which is automatically added to the ".gitignore" file which acts as cache for all of the external modules
                    we add to our project. To finish off the structure, we create an "app.js" Javascript file in which we will write code to
                    use the Express package and create a CRUD REST API as well as a Web Server for serving HTML pages like in this case.
                </p>

        <div id="container-top">
            <div id="header">
                <h2>Setting up app.js</h2>

                    <p>
                        Here we see an "app.js" file in which we start to use the Express package. First we import the package by 
                        using the require method and setting it to a const called "express" - this is similar to the Java "import"
                        statement. Then we create an "app" const and assign the "express" package to it by calling "express()". 
                        Now the "app" const contains all of the Express methods and functions we will use. First one is the 
                        GET method which actually represents the HTTP GET method - used for requesting and reading data from a specified
                        source.<br><br>When calling this "get()" method, we pass the following params:<br><br><br>
                        <b><i>1. PATH / ENDPOINT:</i></b><br>
                        - this represents the endpoint through which we will access the data being read<br>
                        - example "localhost:8080/" where "/" is the endpoint, and it servers an empty JSON object<br><br>
                        <b><i>2. REQ & RES:</i></b><br>
                        - "req" as in request, mostly used when a path variable or a query string is passed in the URL<br>
                        - "res" as in response, used to send/serve the actual data<br>
                        - "/me" endpoint - response object sends an object called "me", and this JSON object is represented on this
                        exact path<br><br>        
                    </p>
                </div>
                <p>
                    Last line of code is the "app.listen()" method, which is used to assign a port through which we will access
                    any of the endpoints defined in the "app.js" - any free port number can be passed here as so -- "app.listen(8081)" 
                    which leads to "localhost:8081" and then any of the endpoints, either through the browser or for example
                    Postman. This method later becomes more complex, as we create a callback function for error-logging
                    and we also play around with scripts and running our server on custom ports. To follow up on the next material we learnt in
                    this class, go to the CRUD REST API tab in the content dropdown or <a href="/crudRestApi">click here</a>.
