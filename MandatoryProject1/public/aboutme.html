                        Hi! My name is David Krtolica and this is my Node.Js mandatory project web-page. I really hope you like it. I am
                        a student, originally from a small town in Croatia called Rijeka. It is a really pretty town on the shore, overlooking
                        the Adriatic sea. My whole life I was an excellent student, and I always had a thing for computers, mobile phones and
                        informatics in general. But unfortunately I never pursued that passion, until the moment I decided to move to Copenhagen, 
                        Denmark to study at KEA's Computer Science program. Since I have started, I feel like I made huge progress in many aspects
                        of my life, but the most important thing is that I finally found what I want to do for the rest of my life.<br><br>
                        Other then Computer Science, I also like playing football and I am quite an outdoors type of person (which is quite
                        rare for somebody who wants to spend their life in the IT field). I love fashion and I think I have an obsession over
                        shoes, for me there is no limit on how much pairs a person should have... That would be pretty much it, if you'd like
                        to check out my social media, visit:<br><br><br>
