                <p>
                    Before creating our first CRUD REST API, we had to understand a few more important elements. As we already know from
                    our previous semester, a CRUD API consists of 4 main parts:
                </p>
                <li>
                    Methods for READING the data - in our case the GET HTTP method which retrieves all of the data which is to be read 
                    in two different ways (get all ["/bikes"] and get by ID ["/bikes/5"], also ["/bikes?brand=TREK"])
                </li>
                <li>
                    A method for CREATING data - POST HTTP method where we pass a JSON object in the body of the request and create a 
                    new resource (also at ["/bikes"], so ID is auto-assigned)
                </li>
                <li>
                    A method for UPDATING data - here we can use either PUT or PATCH HTTP method, to get a resource by some unique
                    property only that resource has (obviously ID) and change some parts of it's data (endpoint is ["/bikes/ID"]
                    where ID is the ID of the bike we want to update)
                </li>
                <li>
                    Last is the DELETE data option - HTTP DELETE method for deleting a specific resource at corresponding ID, so once
                    again we have ["/bikes/ID"] where ID is the ID of the wanted bike
                </li>
                <p>To be able to create all of these methods, we need 2 import elements: QUERY STRING and URL PATH VARIABLES...</p><br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/url_anatomy.png" id="pic-content">
                    <p style="margin: 40px 0 0 15px;">
                        As we can see from this URL anatomy picture, we are interested in how to manipulate the elements at number 6  and 7
                        because they are the ones we will use to filter out specific resources and manipulate them as we wish...<br><br><br>
                        Number 6, the so called URL PATH, is something where we will pass the unique ID of the resource we want to read, update
                        or delete. For example, if we want to delete a resource with the ID of 2, the endpoint would be ["/bikes/2"] and
                        the method used would the the DELETE HTTP method...Same endpoint would be for all other actions as it points to a resource
                        with this exact ID, but the code afterwards differs on the method.<br><br> Number 7 on the other hand, also called a
                        "query string" is something we pass in the URL after the path variable and it is used to filter out the resources we
                        are retrieveing by a specific property... For example, if the resources were bikes and they had a "brand property, and in
                        our "database" we had a few bikes of the brand "Trek", we could retrieve all "Trek" bikes if the query string passed is 
                        equal to "Trek" as in ["localhost:8081/bikes?brand=Trek"] -- so basically its implementation is in the GET method.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Here are a few examples and exercises we have done with path vars and query strings (and also the advanced "app.listen()"):
                </p>
                <br>

                <img src="/applisten_advanced.png" id="pic-content">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Both path and query string are properties of the req (request) object. To access the path, we use "req.params.PATH" and 
                    to access the query string we say "req.query" - then once we get either of those we can create code  such as if statements
                    where we check the query string or path passed with corresponding resource properties to filter them out.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Now that we have most of the knowledge to create a complete CRUD REST API, we started working on one. But to do a CRUD
                    we first had to decide on what is going to be our data... So we defined it as a "plants" array which contains multiple
                    plant objects. These "plant" objects have 2 main props - "ID" and "name". We also have 2 more things to define - 
                    the Express JSON body-parser which we will use in our POST method when creating a new plant, and an ID which will 
                    from that point on auto-increment every time we create a new "plant" object. Here is how our "app.js" looks in the beginning: 
                </p><br>
                <img src="/plants_array.png" id="pic-content">
                <p>
                    Next are the methods for Creating, Reading, Updating and Deleting... In this section I will provide code snippets of my
                    solutions for each one and briefly explain each one of them.
                </p>
                <img src="/get_methods.png" id="pic-content-smaller">
                <br>
                <p>
                    Here we have the GET methods, one for retrieveing all "plant" object from the array, and one for finding a specific plant
                    by its ID. In the first GET method, I have also implemented the query string option for searching, so that the API provides
                    an option to search by the "name" property of the plant as well. If a query string is passed, then it is compared with the 
                    name of each "plant" object from the array. If nothing is passed ("plantName == undefined"), the response object returns
                    the whole "plants" array. In the GET by ID method, we do a very similiar thing - the passed "plant ID" is passed as a path 
                    variable, taken from the "req.params" and then we traverse the array to find if there is any plant associated to that ID. If
                    found, it is return as data through the "res.send()" method.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/post_method.png" id="pic-content">
                    <img src="/post_postman.png" id="pic-content" style="margin-top: -6px;">
                </div>
                <p>
                    Here we can find the POST method for creating a resource. To achieve this, we have to use the POSTMAN API which allows
                    us to define the type of HTTP method we want to use and after passing the correct path ["localhost:8080/plants"] we can
                    send the request body as raw JSON, which is accessed by the "req.body". We assign this JSON body to a "newPlant" object,
                    define its ID and add it to our "plants" array using the "plants.push()" method. To be able to pass this body of the
                    request, we had to define the "app.use(express.json());" line of code, which allows us to access and manipulate it.
                </p>
                <br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/patch_method.png" id="pic-content">
                    <p>
                        The PATCH method is a bit more complex. Again, we find the wanted "plant" object by using the "req.params", as
                        when we want to update a plant, first we must find it by its unique ID. Once found, we have to exchange the body
                        of this "plant" object which is to be updated with the request body, without changing the ID itself (since we are
                        not creating a new resource, we are updating an existing one.) So we use this "map()" object with a callback function
                        in which we first check the corresponding IDs, and then we use so called SPREAD OPERATORS to take the "plant" object,
                        assign the object which is sent in the body to the "plant" object and last to set its ID to the ID of the "plant" 
                        which was previously found.<br><br>
                        Essentially, we could have done it by assigning the "req.body" to an object called "updatedPlant", and then set the
                        "updatedPlant" to the "plant" object which was found in the first place, but this way of updating is less efficient
                        as we are creating new objects and using more memory.   
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/delete_method.png" id="pic-content">
                    <p style="margin-top: 0;">
                        Last but not least is the DELETE method. It is much simpler then the other methods. Here, we just get the passed
                        path ID, and do a filter method on the "plants" array with a condition that if the "plant ID" and the path ID 
                        are not the same, it should keep all of the "plant" object which fulfill this condition, and it should 
                        filter out/ remove all "plant" objects which have the ID corresponding to the path ID. To explain on an example, 
                        if we say ["localhost:8080/plants/2"] on a DELETE method, it will go through the "plants" array and keep all
                        "plant" object which don't have an ID = 2, and remove the one which has.
