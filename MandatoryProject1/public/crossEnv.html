                    Another very useful "npm package" which we used and installed manually is the "cross-env" package. This package is
                    extremely helpful for running scripts and setting environment variable completely independently of the platform 
                    (Windows, Linux, MacOS...). To installed, the process is quite similar to installing the "express" package - we
                    run this command ("npm install --save-dev cross-env") in our terminal at the wanted project directory. This will
                    create this "devDependencies" module on, line 8 of the left picture, and once again it will state the dependency
                    and its version. Now we can use the "cross-env" package. <br><br>
                    On line 2, we defined a key-value pair where the key is called "scripts", and the value is a curly-bracket annotation
                    (as an annotation for an empty object) in which we find one more key-value pair. We created this key-value pair on
                    our own, and we called the key "start-dev" and value "cross-env PORT=8081 nodemon app.js". So here, we are basically
                    defining a few things:
                    <li>First thing mentioned is the "cross-env" package which allows the cross-platform usage</li>
                    <li>
                        Then we mention this "PORT=8081" - this is an environment variable, and it is accessed in the "app.js"
                        on line 69 (right picture) by saying "process.env.PORT", saying that the server should run on the port which we
                        assign in this script
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        And last is the actual server "run" method which is in this case defined by <a href="/nodemon">NODEMON</a>,
                        which is another npm package we used for running our server.
                    </li>
                </p>
                <p>
                    So to conclude, we defined the final version of the "app.listen()" method in this "app.js" class. We say that the port
                    should be either the port defined as an environment variable (when running the script, so 8081), and if not then when we
                    run the server as per usual ("node app.js" or "nodemon app.js"), then the port is 8080.<br><br>
                    To run the script on the other hand, we say ("npm run start-dev").
