                    Node.js is an open-source, cross platform, back-end Javascript runtime environment which executes
                    Javascript code outside a web browser. It allows developers to use and write command-line tools and
                    scripts for producing dynamic web page content before even sending it to the user's web browser.
                    <br><br>I took this class because I am extremely interested in learning more about web-application development
                    environments and also Javascript in general. I have learnt Java in my first 3 semesters at KEA, so I also assumed
                    that it would be an advantage in learning Javascript, which I am currently using in some of my private projects - 
                    it is the will to learn more which drove me to this course and I am extremely happy to be a part of it as I feel 
                    like I am learning a lot.

                    Currently, we are using Express (like on this web page) to server web pages in which you can find content about
                    what we have learnt so far in the semester. We are mostly focusing on serving web pages by using the GET method
                    and then defining at which path we will serve this HTML file. If you look closely in the URL bar, you will see 
                    "localhost:PORT" or "localhost:PORT/", or maybe even "localhost:PORT/index" - this is the path which serves the
                    index page where you are currently at and where you can find general content and web page structure info.<br><br>To learn more about specifics from 
                    this Node.js class on 4th semester AP in Computer Science, open the content tab or press <a href="/content">here</a>.
