                    Briefly explained, "express" is a Javascript package, or to be more precise it is a Node.js module that is available
                    through the npm registry. To use it, we first have to have Node.js installed on our computers. Once Node is installed,
                    we open our project directory where we want to install "express" (as mentioned before, we open an empty folder and create
                    an empty "package.json" file with an empty "{}" annotation) and we run "npm install express" as a terminal command in the
                    wanted directory (which we can access using the terminal command "cd" meaning "change directory"). Now, in our "package.json"
                    , we will see the express dependency installed like this:
                </p>
                <br>
                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/express_dep.png" id="pic-content">
                    <p>
                        Here, the "^4.17.1" is the assignment of the "express" package version, meaning that we will use version 4.17.1 or
                        higher... If we were to add more dependencies like express, they would be added here next to "express".
                    </p>
                </div>
                <br>
                <p>
                    By documentation, "express" is defined as a "fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for node". Also, they say
                    that "the Express philosophy is to provide small, robust tooling for HTTP servers, making it a great solution for single page 
                    applications, web sites, hybrids, or public HTTP APIs". In our case, this wasa exactly what we needed to create our first
                    <a href="/crudRestApi">API</a> and <a href="/expressWideWeb">Web-server</a>, with a minimum understanding of Javascript
                    basics.<br><br>
                    So once we got everything installed, we moved on to create our first server. To see how this worked out and how we
                    manifested the usage of "express", visit the <a href="/courseStart">Course Start page</a> where you can find the basic
                    usage and structure of our "express" server.
