                    So what is Nodemon? Nodemon is a very useful tool, or to be precise an npm package, that allows developers to easily
                    restart their node applications with having to manually stop and start them over and over. The usual process is to run
                    an application via "node app.js", then when we implement a change, we first stop the server (CTRL + c) and start it 
                    again using the same command.<br><br>
                    Nodemon on the other hand recognizes all file changes from our directory, and as soon as a change happens, it restarts
                    the application by stopping and starting it again itself... And for its usage, it is extremely simple to use - just instead
                    of writing "node", we just say "nodemon" and then the .js file. When installing Nodemon, we do not install it like "express"
                    or the "cross-env" dependency - the reason behind this is that we of course can do that, but we were suggested by our teacher
                    to simply install "Nodemon" globally, so that we can use it for any project/ application we create and not only for a specific
                    one.<br><br> 
                    To install "Nodemon" globally, we have to write this command in the terminal: ("npm install -g nodemon") - now it is 
                    installed globally to our system path. To get it as a dev-tool (so like "cross-env"), we run ("npm install --save-dev nodemon").

                <div id="row-container">
                    <img src="/nodemon_terminal.png" id="pic-content">
                    <p style="margin-top: 60px;">
                        On this screenshot we can see that I ran the script as mentioned in the <a href="/crossEnv">cross-env page</a>,
                        and then the script runs the command "nodemon app.js".<br><br>
                        Then we see that "nodemon" is starting, saying at what path, which version of it is running and also what commands
                        to run if we want to restart "nodemon" itself. We can also see that there were some changes made, so "nodemon"
                        did the refreshing itself (3 times in total automatically and once I ran the rs command to manually restart).
